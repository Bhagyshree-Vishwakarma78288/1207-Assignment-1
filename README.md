# 1207-Assignment-1
 In this MongoDB assignment, we practiced CRUD operations and various queries using student data in VS Code. We learned to filter, update, and aggregate data, enhancing our understanding of MongoDB's capabilities for effective database management.
 
Key Learnings from This Project:
MongoDB Querying: Gained hands-on experience with CRUD operations and complex queries.
Data Manipulation: Learned how to filter, update, and delete records effectively.
Aggregation Framework: Explored techniques to summarize and analyze data.
Practical Application: Developed practical skills for real-world database management tasks.

Problem Solving Statement
In this project, we aimed to develop our skills in MongoDB by working with a sample dataset of students. The primary challenge was to effectively query, update, and manipulate the data to extract meaningful insights. By practicing various operations, we addressed issues such as filtering specific records, handling updates, and performing aggregations, ultimately enhancing our proficiency in database management and problem-solving using MongoDB.
